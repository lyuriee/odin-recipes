    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large nonreactive bowl, stir together the onion, garlic, lemon
        grass, soy sauce, peanut oil, turmeric, brown sugar, cumin, ginger,
        salt, and pepper. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade in a small
        bowl, and refrigerate until cooking time. Mix the chicken breasts into
        the remaining marinade, stir to coat well, and marinate in refrigerator
        overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        About 30 minutes before serving, soak the skewers in water. Preheat an
        outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the chicken breasts from the bowl, and discard the used marinade.
        Cut each chicken breast on the diagonal into 6 long strips, and thread a
        chicken strip onto one of the soaked skewers. Grill the skewers, turning
        frequently and basting with the reserved marinade, until the chicken is
        cooked through with brown, crispy edges, 5 to 8 minutes per skewer.
      </li>
    </ol>
