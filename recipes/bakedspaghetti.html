    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>16oz of spaghetti</li>
      <li>1lb ground beef</li>
      <li>1 chopped onion</li>
      <li>32oz of meatless spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of grated parmesan</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons of melted butter</li>
      <li>2 cups of small curd cotta cheese, divided</li>
      <li>5 cups of shredded mozza cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 175degrees C. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to the bite,
        about 12 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in
        the hot skillet until meat is browned and onion is soft and translucent,
        about 7 minutes. Drain excess oil from the pan. Stir in spaghetti sauce
        and seasoned salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and toss
        to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared dish. Top with 1/2 of
        the cottage cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of meat sauce. Repeat
        layers. Cover with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle
        with remaining mozzarella. Continue to bake until cheese is melted and
        lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
